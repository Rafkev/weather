# weather
This code fetches the weather forecast for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. You need to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key. This code fetches a 5-day weather forecast in 3-hour intervals for the specified city and logs the forecast data to the console. You can modify the displayWeatherForecast function to display the forecast data in your desired format or integrate it into a web page for a user interface.
